## Hi there üëã
My name is Slice (not my real name, but please call me Slice), I'm a developer with a wide range of projects and I have experience in many different areas.
Since the start of 2020 I picked up coding and started with Discord bots, eventually I worked to get experience in a lot of other areas aswell like Unity mod development.

## Skills
### Unity Modding (2024 - Present)
At the start of 2024 I attempted modding Lethal Company which taught me a lot about Unity, C# and Unity game modding.
During this time I made the Lethal Company Chaos Mod where I made a lot of cool effects inside the game that trigger randomly.
This mod was then played by a small amount of people, [here's an example of someone playing with the mod](https://youtu.be/9uurHFhZjvk).
At the end of 2024 the horror game MiSide was released for which I made a mod to help speedrunners.
This game is compiled with IL2CPP so I also learned a lot about IL2CPP modding.

### Minecraft Plugins (2022 - 2025)
I've made a few private Minecraft Java plugins mostly focussed on implementing minigames.
Although most of these projects were very ambitious and were never fully released I'm still very happy with some of the work I did on those projects.
Currently I don't have any active projects for Minecraft plugins.

### Discord Bots (2020 - Present)
Discord bots is how I really got into coding and I still maintain a few (private) bots that aid in using Discord a lot.
These bots are all made in Javascript (nodejs, discord.js).
I've explored many parts of the discord functionality through these bots.

### Website Backend Development (2020 - Present)
I've spent quite a lot of time on website backends making things functional and keeping them secure.
I wouldn't say I'm an expert but I'm definitely aware of quite a few flaws that are easy to forget about in web development and try to make sure that these are patched before they get abused.
Apart from finding bugs and security issues I mostly focus on making websites functional and not much in frontend/design.
