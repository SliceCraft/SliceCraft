## Hi there 👋
My name is Slice (not my real name, but please call me Slice), I'm a developer with a wide range of projects and I have experience in many different areas.
Since the start of 2020 I picked up coding and started with Discord bots, eventually I worked to get experience in a lot of other areas aswell like Unity mod development.
